# Introduction

changelog.dart is a collection of tools to manages in a fashion way a repository as maintainer.

In particular one of the issue if a maintainer works with different project in different language, is the standart
that a community may use.

For example, dart community has a very defined standard to generate the changelog.

With this tools you can forget to create your own script for each language, or project but you can use a single command line tools
or you can develop your own command line tools with the changelog_lib package that provided all the building blocks to create a well defined
changelog.

# How to Use

You can find in the repository two different package, that are:

- changelog_cmd: That provide a command line application to interface with Github API or git command line (WIP) to extract the metadata from commits;
- changelog_lib: That provide a library to build a changelog generator without rewrite the own logic.

To see how to use tha package, please see the package homepage.
